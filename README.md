Off-label coding agent workflows for life tasks. Fork and adapt for your own uses.

- **[todoist](./todoist)** — Organize tasks, move things between sections, batch operations

## Usage

Copy a skill to your agent's skills directory:

```bash
cp -r todoist ~/.claude/skills/
```

The agent auto-discovers it when relevant. Or open the folder and tell your agent to read `SKILL.md`.

Built using the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io) for portability across tools.
